Q/A: Suppose a newly-born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, are put in a field. 
Rabbits can mate at the age of one month sothat at the end of its second month, a female can produce another pair of rabbits. 
Suppose that rabbits never die and that the female always has one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second monthon.
Howmanypairswilltherebe in one year?



Solution: ● They mate at the end of the first month, but there is still one, only one pair.
● At the end of the second month, the female produces a new pair, so two pairs of rabbits are in the field. 
● At the end of the third month, the original female produces a second pair, making three pairs in the field. 
● At the end of the fourth month, the original female has produced another new pair. 
The female born two months ago produces her first pair also, making five pairs.
If we carefully notice the pattern, it’s a Fibonacci Series, where F(n) represents the number of pairs of rabbits at the end of the nth month.
F(0)=F(1)=1; F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2);
So the series is: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144… So at the end of 12 months, we’ll have 144 pairs, i.e. 288 rabbits. 2
