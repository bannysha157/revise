2)Find a six-digit number containing no zeros and no repeated digits that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The first and fourth digits sum to the last digit, as do the third and fifth digits.
2. The first and second digits when read as a two-digit number equal one quarter the fourth and fifth digits.
3. The last digit is four times the third digit.

Answer:
final 192768.
If you call the number ABCDEF, then you get the following equations.

1. A + D = F and C + E = F
2. AB = DE / 4
3. F = 4 Ã— C

The only numbers that work for C and E are 2 and 6 or 4 and 8, and in order to make F a single-digit number we can deduce that C = 2, E = 6 and F = 8.
So far, our number is AB2D68.

We know A + D = 8 so A and D are both odd numbers.
The only odd number less than 8 that we can use for D to make one-quarter of two-digit number D6 also be a two-digit number is 7,
so D = 7 and A is 1. This makes the two-digit number AB 19.
