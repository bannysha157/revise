Method 1:using clear() method

# Creating list
list = [6, 0, 4, 1]
print('list before clear:', list)
# Clearing list
list.clear()
print('list after clear:', list)

o/p=
list before clear: [6, 0, 4, 1]
list after clear: []


Method 2 : Using “*= 0” : This is a lesser known method, but this method removes all elements of the list and makes it empt

# Initializing lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
# Printing list1 before deleting 
print ("List1 before deleting is : " + str(list1))
# deleting list using *= 0
list1 *= 0
# Printing list1 after *= 0
print ("List1 after clearing using *= 0: " + str(list1))

Output:
List1 before deleting is : [1, 2, 3]
List1 after clearing using *= 0: []
